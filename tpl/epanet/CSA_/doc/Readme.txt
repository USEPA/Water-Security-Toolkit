All requests for bug-fixes to CSA are being managed using server
software called Bugzilla. Bugzilla is an online bug-tracking system. To
report a new EPANET-MSX bug, please do the following to ensure that your
bug is recorded for eventual action:

1. Go to http://engcvs.uc.edu and select "Bugzilla" at the top of the page.
2. If this is your first bug entry, select "open a new Bugzilla account" and
   follow the on-line instructions.
3. Enter your login (your email address) and password.
4. Select "Enter a new bug report"
5. Select "CSA"
6. If this is your first bug report, it is helpful to first read the "bug writing
   guidelines."
7. Select the version, component, platform, operating system, and severity; enter
   a summary description of the bug, and a more detailed text description.
8. Select "commit" to store your bug report and automatically forward it to the
   developers for action.

Following the above procedures will help to ensure that EPANET-MSX bugs are
addressed in a timely manner.
