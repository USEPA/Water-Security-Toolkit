MSX 1.00.01
05/05/2008

The following bugs are fixed.

1. Report file specified in the [REPORT] section of the msx configuration file is not generated. Instead the multispecies 
modeling results are written to the EPANET report file.

2. Memory violation error may occur when toolkit function MSXsavemsxfile is called.

3. A source node which is defined as “setpoint” source behaves like “flowpaced” source and vice versa.

4. MSXsetpattern did not set the current patternvalue index to be the first.

Pipe roughness is added as a reserved hydraulic variable. The keyword is Kc.
