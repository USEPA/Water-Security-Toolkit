The PyEPANET Package

This Python package is a wrapper around the EPANET Programmers Toolkit that refactors the EPANET functions into a more pythonic format. Specifically, using the EPANET library directly in Python requires knowing the ctypes package, and learning how to pass variables by reference within Python. This package does that for the user. This way, the user can get values the “normal” python way – as returned values.

__ Installing the EPANET DLL

  To use PyEPANET you must already have the EPANET2 DLL compiled and installed in a place Python knows about. On Linux/Unix/Mac OSX machines, this means somewhere searched by default (such as /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib) or within the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable. On Windows, the DLL should be in the system directory, or within the site-packages/pyepanet directory, or within the directory where the program will be executed.

__ Constants and Strings

  The EPANET Programmers Toolkit help files are the best place to start when trying to learn what the functions do. However, the most basic help has been added as pydoc-style docstrings within the package, so “help (pyepanet)” should give the user a place to start. All the EN_ enumerated constants that are defined in the DLL are also defined in the package, for example, “pyepanet.EN_NODECOUNT” will provide the correct value for the “EN_NODECOUNT” constant.

  To get a list of appropriate constants, see the “opt*” constants defined in the PyEPANET package. For example, the “pyepanet.optComponentCounts” array will list the string values for all the constants having to do with component counts. Again, using “help (pyepanet)” will provide a list of all the constants.

__ Loading the EPANET DLL

  To create an EPANET object, do the following:
	import pyepanet
	MyNet = pyepanet.ENepanet()
	MyNet.ENopen(‘MyInputFile.inp’,’myOutput.rpt’)

  To get, for example, the number of nodes in the network, do the following:
	numNodes = MyNet.ENgetcount(pyepanet.EN_NODECOUNT)

  Remember to close the EPANET object with the following before loading a new file:
	MyNet.ENclose()

  To get a list of all the methods defined within the class, along with a brief description of both the method and its parameters, use “help (pyepanet.ENepanet)”

__ Additional Notes

  There is one non-standard method within the ENepanet() class. These are there if the user wants to use the EPANET DLL like an executable. 
	from pyepanet import ENepanet
	A = ENepanet()
	A.epanetExec(‘mynetwork.inp’,’mynetwork.rpt’,’mynetwork.bin’)

  This form automatically closes the EPANET data structure after running, and the user does not need to run the ENclose function.
