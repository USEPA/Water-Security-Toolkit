Water Security Toolkit README
=============================

The Water Security Toolkit (WST) is a suite of tools that provides
information to develop consequence management strategy for water
utilities. WST is intended to assist in:
 - Planning response actions to natural disasters and terrorist attacks,
 - Informing large-scale exercises/training,
 - Planning response actions to address traditional utility challenges,
      such as pipe breaks and water quality problems, and
 - Evaluating implications of different response strategies.

WST assists in the evaluation of multiple response actions in order to
select the most beneficial consequence management strategy. WST includes
hydraulic and water quality modeling software and optimization
methodologies to identify: (1) sensor locations to detect contamination,
(2) locations in the network in which the contamination was introduced,
(3) hydrants to remove contaminated water from the distribution system,
(4) locations in the network to inject decontamination agents to
inactivate, remove, or destroy contaminants, (5) locations in the
network to take grab sample to confirm contamination or cleanup, and (6)
valves to close in order to isolate contaminated areas of the network.

The capabilities in WST can be accessed from command-line tools. WST can
be used within either a MS Windows DOS shell or any standard Unix shell.

INSTALLATION
============
WST can be installed on MS Windows using a self-cofiguring ZIP file.
Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a location of your choosing
(e.g., C:\WST), and then run the bin\wst.exe command to configure the
software for use.  

Installation on OSX or Linux should be performed by compiling WST from
source:
        ./setup configure
        make

See the included WST User Manual for further details.

GETTING STARTED
===============
The WST User Manual (doc\userman.pdf) provides a detailed
description of the command-line tools in WST. The examples used in this
manual can be accessed in the examples directory.
