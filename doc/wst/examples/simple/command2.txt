Usage: tevasim [options] <epanet-input-file> <epanet-output-file>
                              <erd-db-name>
A utility for running an ensemble of water quality simulations, whose results
are stored in a TSO file.

options:

      --dvf                   The Decision Variable File (DVF) file used to
                              specify the flushing/valve controls.
  -h, --help                  Display usage information
      --mss                   The MSX species to save.
      --msx                   The MSX file for specifying multi-species
                              EPANET.
      --tsg                   The TSG file used to specify the injection
                              incidents.
      --tsi                   The TSI file used to specify the injection
                              incidents.
      --version               Display version information

arguments:

  epanet-input-file:  EPANET network file.

  epanet-output-file:  Output file generated by EPANET.

  erd-db-name:  The ERD database name.  A directory can be specified as part
      of this name - if there is one, the db files will be stored there

The tevasim command is used to simulate contamination incidents. This command
uses EPANET to perform an ensemble of contaminant transport simulations,
defined by a TSG File. The following files are generated during the execution
of tevasim:
  - a binary ERD file that contains the contamination transport data,
  - a binary SDX file that provides an index into the ERD File, and
  - an output file that provides a textual summary of the EPANET simulations.

Note that options like `tsg' can be specified with the syntax `--tsg file.tsg'
or `--tsg=file.tsg'.
