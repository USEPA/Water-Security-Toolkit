Usage: createIPData [options...] <config-file>
A command to generate AMPL data files, which are used by integer programming
solvers.

options:

      --gamma                 The fraction of the tail used to compute VaR and
                              TCE statistics
  -h, --help                  Display usage information
      --output                The output file
      --version               Display version information

arguments:

  config-file:  Contains all of the information needed to setup a sensor
      placement problem.

The createIPData executable is used to setup an integer programming problemfor
sensor placement that can be solved using the GeneralSP IP model.The
configuration file input file is generated by the sp optimizationscript.  The
output of this executable consists of AMPL data commandsthat are used to
generate an instance of the GeneralSP IP model.
