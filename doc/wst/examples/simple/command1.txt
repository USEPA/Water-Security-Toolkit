Usage: tso2Impact [options] <output-prefix> <tso-directory-or-files>
                              <tai-directory-or-files>
An application that reads a TSO file (and associated TAI file if health
impacts are to be computed) and creates one or more impact files that are used
to formulate sensor placement problems.

options:

      --dec                   If this option is specified, an impact file will
                              be generated for the `detected extent of
                              contamination' measure.
      --detectionConfidence   The number of sensors that must detect an event
                              before the impacts are calculated.  Normally
                              this is 1 sensor.
  -d, --detectionLimit        A list of thresholds needed to perform detection
                              with a sensor.  There must be one threshold for
                              each .tso file. The units of these detection
                              limits depend on the units of the contaminant
                              simulated for each TSO file (e.g. number of
                              cells of a biological agent).
      --dmc                   If this option is specified, an impact file will
                              be generated for the `detected mass consumed'
                              measure.

                              measure.  This is an intensive measure to
                              compute.
      --dpe                   If this option is specified, an impact file wll

                              exposed' measure.  This is an intensive measure
                              to compute.
      --dpk                   If this option is specified, an impact file wll

                              killed' measure.  This is an intensive measure
                              to compute.
      --dtd                   If this option is specified, an impact file will
                              be generated for the `detected
                              time-to-detection' measure.
      --dvc                   If this option is specified, an impact file will
                              be generated for the `detected volume consumed'
                              measure.
      --dvf                   This is used to correct demands generated for
                              flushing response calculations
      --ec                    If this option is specified, an impact file will
                              be generated for the `extent of contamination'
                              measure.

      --nfd                   If this option is specified, an impact file will
                              be generated for the `number-of-failed
                              detections' measure.
      --pd                    If this option is specified, an impact file wll
                              be generated for the `population dosed' measure.
                              This is an intensive measure to compute.
      --pe                    If this option is specified, an impact file wll
                              be generated for the `population exposed'
                              measure.  This is an intensive measure to
                              compute.
      --pk                    If this option is specified, an impact file wll
                              be generated for the `population killed'
                              measure.  This is an intensive measure to
                              compute.
  -r, --responseTime          This option indicates the number of minutes that
                              are needed to respond to the detection of a
                              continant.  As the response time increases, the
                              impact increases because the contaminant affects
                              the network for a greater length of time. Unit:
                              minutes.
      --species               Name of species to use in computing impacts.
      --td                    If this option is specified, an impact file will
                              be generated for the `time-to-detection'
                              measure.
      --tec                   If this option is specified, an impact file will
                              be generated for the `timed extent of
                              contamination' measure.
      --vc                    If this option is specified, an impact file will
                              be generated for the `volume consumed' measure.
      --version               Display version information

arguments:

  output-prefix:  The prefix used for all files generated by tso2Impact.

  erd-or-tso-file:  This argument indicates either a TSO or ERD file.

  tai-directory-or-file:  This argument indicates a TAI file name.  The TAI
      input file is a threat_assess input that specifies parameters like
      dosage, response, lethality, etc.  There should be one TAI file for each
      TSO file.

Note that options like `responseTime' can be specified with the syntax
`--responseTime 10.0' or `--responseTime=10.0'.
