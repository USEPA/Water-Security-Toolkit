  --objective=OBJECTIVE
                        Objective names have the form: <goal>_<statistic>
                        ..The objective goals are:
                        ....cost   the cost of sensor placement
                        ....ec     extent of contamination
                        ....dec    detected extent of contamination
                        ....td     time to detection

                        ..The objective statistics are:
                        ....mean   the mean impact
                        ....median the median impact

                        ....worst  the worst impact
                        An objective name of the form <goal> is assumed to
                        refer to the objective <goal>_mean.  This option may
                        be listed more than once.
  -r DELAY, --responseTime=DELAY
                        This parameter indicates the number of minutes that
                        are needed to respond to the detection of a
                        contaminant.  As the response time increases, the
                        impact increases because the contaminant affects the
                        network for a greater length of time. Unit: minutes.
  -g GAMMA, --gamma=GAMMA
                        Specifies the fraction of the distribution of impacts
                        that will be used to compute the var, cvar and tce
                        measures.  Gamma is assumed to lie in the interval
                        (0,1].  It can be interpreted as specifying the
                        100*gamma percent of the worst contamination incidents
                        that are used for these calculations.  Default: .05
  --incident-weights=INCIDENT_WEIGHTS
                        This parameter specifies a file that contains the
                        weights for contamination incidents.  This file
                        supports the optimization of weighted impact metrics.
                        By default, incidents are optimized with weight 1.0
  --imperfect-scfile=SCFILE
                        Specifies the name of a file defining detection
                        probabilities for all sensor categories. Used with the
                        imperfect-sensor model.  Must be specified in
                        conjunction with the --imperfect-jcfile option.
  --imperfect-jcfile=JCFILE
                        Specifies the name of a file defining a sensor
                        category for each network junction. Used with the
                        imperfect-sensor model. Must be specified in
                        conjunction with the --imperfect-scfile option.
  --num=NUMSAMPLES, --numsamples=NUMSAMPLES
                        Specifies the number of candidate solutions generated
                        by the grasp heuristic. Defaults vary based on
                        statistic and sensor model formulation (perfect vs.
                        imperfect).
  --grasp-representation=GRASP_REPRESENTATION
                        Specifies whether the grasp heuristic uses a sparse
                        matrix (0) or dense matrix (1) representation to store
                        the impact file contents.  The default is 1.
  --impact-dir=IMPACT_DIRECTORY
                        Specifies the directory the contains impact files.  By
                        default the current directory is used.
  --aggregation-threshold=AGGREGATION_THRESHOLD, --threshold=AGGREGATION_THRESHOLD
                        Specifies the value (as `<goal>,<value>') used to
                        aggregate `similar' impacts.  This is used to reduce
                        the total size of the sensor placement formulation
                        (for large problems). The solution generated with non-
                        zero thresholds is not guaranteed to be globally
                        optimal.
  --aggregation-percent=AGGREGATION_PERCENT, --percent=AGGREGATION_PERCENT
                        A `<goal>,<value>' pair where value is a double
                        between 0.0 and 1.0.  This is an alternate way to
                        compute the aggregation threshold. Over all
                        contamination incidents, we compute the maximum
                        difference d between the impact of the contamination
                        incident is not detected and the impact it is detected
                        at the earliest possible feasible location.  We set
                        the threshold to d * aggregation_percent.  If both
                        threshold and percent are set to valid values in the
                        command line, percent takes priority.
  --aggregation-ratio=AGGREGATION_RATIO
                        A `<goal>,<value>' pair where value is a double
                        between 0.0 and 1.0.
  --conserve-memory=MAXIMUM_IMPACTS
                        If location aggregation is chosen, and the original
                        impact files are very large, you can choose to process
                        them in a memory conserving mode.  For example "--
                        conserve_memory=10000" requests that while original
                        impact files are being processed into smaller
                        aggregated files, no more than 10000 impacts should be
                        read into memory at any one time.  Default is 10000
                        impacts.  Set to 0 to turn this off.
  --distinguish-detection=DISTINGUISH_GOAL, --no-event-collapse=DISTINGUISH_GOAL
                        A goal for which aggregation should not allow
                        incidents to become trivial.That is, if the threshold
                        is so large that all locations, including the dummy,
                        would form a single superlocation, this forces the
                        dummy to be in a superlocation by itself.  Thus the
                        sensor placement will distinguish between detecting
                        and not detecting. This option can be listed multiple
                        times, to specify multiple goals.Note: the `detected'
                        impact measures (e.g. dec, dvc) are always
                        distinguished.
  --disable-aggregation=DISABLE_AGGREGATION
                        Disable aggregation for this goal, even at value zero,
                        which would incur no error.  Each witness incident
                        will be in a separate superlocation. This option can
                        be listed multiple times, to specify multiple goals.
                        You may list the goal `all' to specify all goals.
  --ub-constraint=UB_CONSTRAINT, --ub=UB_CONSTRAINT
                        This option specifies a constraint (<objective>,<ub-
                        value>) on the maximal value of an objective type.
                        This option can be repeated multiple times with
                        different objectives.
  --baseline-constraint=BASELINE_CONSTRAINT, --baseline=BASELINE_CONSTRAINT
                        Baseline constraints are not currently supported.
  --reduction-constraint=REDUCTION_CONSTRAINT, --reduction=REDUCTION_CONSTRAINT
                        Reduction constraints are not currently supported.
  --costs=COST_FILE, --costs_ids=COST_FILE
                        This file contains costs for the installation of
                        sensors throughout the distribution network.  This
                        file contains id/cost pairs, and default costs can be
                        specified with the id: __default__.
  --costs-indices=COST_INDEX_FILE
                        This file contains costs for the installation of
                        sensors throughout the distribution network.  This
                        file contains index/cost pairs, and default costs can
                        be specified with the index: -1.
  --sensor-locations=LOCATIONS_FILE
                        This file contains information about whether network
                        ids are feasible for sensor placement, and whether a
                        sensor placement is fixed at a given location.
  --solver=SOLVER       This option specifies the type of solver that is used
                        to find sensor placement(s).  The following solver
                        types are currently supported:
                        ..att_grasp  multistart local search heuristic (AT&T)

                        are added to the solver command line.
  --runtime=RUNTIME     Terminate the solver after the specified number of
                        wall clock minutes have elapsed.  By default, no limit
                        is placed on the runtime.  Some solvers can provide
                        their best solution so far at the point of
                        termination.
  --notify=INTERVAL     Some solvers can output preliminary solutions while
                        they are running. This option supplies the interval in
                        minutes at which candidate solutions should be printed
                        out.
  --compute-bound       Only compute a bound on the value of the optimal

                        ..evalsensor        run on evalsensor
                        ..aggregateImpacts  run on aggregateImpacts  Output
                        will be written to memcheck.{name}.{pid} .
  --tmp-file=TMP_FILE   Name of temporary file prefix used in this
                        computation. The default name is `<network-name>'.

  --amplcplexpath=AMPLCPLEXPATH
                        Look for ampl and cplexamp executables in this
                        directory. This defaults to a `blank' path, which
                        implies that the user's system path is used.
  --picopath=PICOPATH   Look for the PICO executable in this directory. This
                        defaults to the path used for executables specified

                        sensor placement with an IP.
  --seed=SEED           The value of a seed for the random number generator
                        used by the solver.  This can be used to ensure a
                        deterministic, repeatable output from the solver.
                        Should be >= 1.
