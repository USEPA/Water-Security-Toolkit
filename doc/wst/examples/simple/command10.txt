  --objective=OBJECTIVE
                        Objective names have the form: <goal>_<statistic>
                        ..The objective goals are:
                        ....cost   the cost of sensor placement
                        ....ec     extent of contamination
                        ....dec    detected extent of contamination
                        ....td     time to detection
                        ....dtd    detected time to detection
                        ....mc     mass consumed
                        ....dmc    detected mass consumed
                        ....nfd    number of failed detections
                        ....ns     the number of sensors
                        ....pe     population exposed
                        ....dpe    detected population exposed

                        ....dpk    detected population killed
                        ....pd     population dosed
                        ....dpd    detected population dosed
                        ....vc     volume consumed
                        ....dvc    detected volume consumed
                        ..The objective statistics are:
                        ....mean   the mean impact
                        ....median the median impact
                        ....var    value-at-risk of impact distribution
                        ....tce    tail-conditioned expectation of imp dist
                        ....cvar   approximation to TCE used with IPs
                        ....worst  the worst impact
                        An objective name of the form <goal> is assumed to
                        refer to the objective <goal>_mean.
  --skeleton=SKELETON   Specifies the pipe diameter threshold used in
                        spotSkeleton.
  --stat=STAT           Statistic used in geographic aggregation of the input
                        file.  Options include:
                        ...min
                        ...max
                        ...mean
                        ...median
                        Streaming algorithms are used to aggregate the impact
                        file. For the median option, the impact file must be
                        sorted.
  --ub1-constraint=UB1_CONSTRAINT, --ub1=UB1_CONSTRAINT
                        This option specifies a constraint (<objective>,<ub-
                        value>) on the maximal value of an objective type in
                        tier 1.

                        This option specifies a constraint (<objective>,<ub-
                        value>) on the maximal value of an objective type in
                        tier 2.
  --solver1=SOLVER1     This option specifies the type of solver that is used
                        to find sensor placement(s) in tier 1.  The following
                        solver types are currently supported:
