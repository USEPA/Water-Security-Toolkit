\subsection{Overview}\label{sideconstraintsExecutable_sideconstraintsOverview}

The {\bfseries sideconstraints} executable heuristically solves p-\/median formulations of the sensor placement problem where one or more side-\/constraints are specified. These side constraints are tight, meaning that any solution that violates the side constraints is considered infeasible.

\subsection{Usage}\label{sideconstraintsExecutable_sideconstraintsUsage}

\begin{verbatim}
   sideconstraints <sp-configuration-file> <num-samples> <random-seed> 
	<impact-file-representation> <time-limit> [<solution-file>]
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Arguments}\label{sideconstraintsExecutable_sideconstraintsArgs}

\begin{verbatim} 
   <sp-configuration-file>
	   The configuration file generated by the `sp' script.

   <num-sample>
	   The number of local searches performed by this heuristic.

   <random-seed>
	   A random number seed.

   <impact-file-representation>
	   An integer that indicates how the impact file is stored internally:
	   0 - sparse and 1 - dense

   <time-limit>
	   A time limit (in seconds) for how long the heuristic should run.

   <solution-file>
	   The name of the output file that contains the solutions found
	   by this heuristic.
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Description}\label{sideconstraintsExecutable_sideconstraintsDescription}

The {\ttfamily sp} command runs {\ttfamily sideconstraints} to solve p-\/median sensor placement problems that include side-\/constraints with the GRASP heuristic. Currently, the following statistics are supported: mean, var (Value At Risk), tce (Tail-\/Conditional Expectation), and worst-\/case.
