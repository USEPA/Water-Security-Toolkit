\subsection{Overview}\label{randomsampleExecutable_randomsampleOverview}
The {\bfseries randomsample} executable heuristically solves p-\/median formulations of the sensor placement problem.
\subsection{Usage}\label{randomsampleExecutable_randomsampleUsage}
\begin{verbatim}
   randomsample <sp-configuration-file> <num-sample> <random-seed> 
            <impact-file-representation> <time-limit> [<solution-file>]
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Arguments}\label{randomsampleExecutable_randomsampleArgs}
\begin{verbatim} 
     <sp-configuration-file>
     The configuration file generated by the 'sp' script.

     <num-sample> 
     The number of local searches performed by this heuristic.

     <random-seed> 
     A random number seed.

     <impact-file-representation>
     An integer that indicates how the impact file is stored internally:
     0 - sparse and 1 - dense

     <time-limit>
     A time limit (in seconds) for how long the heuristic should run.

     <solution-file>
     The name of the output file that contains the solutions found
     by this heuristic.
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Description}\label{randomsampleExecutable_randomsampleDescription}
The {\ttfamily sp} command runs {\ttfamily randomsample} to solve p-\/median sensor sensor placement problems with the GRASP heuristic. Currently, the following statistics are supported: mean, var (Value At Risk), tce (Tail-\/Conditional Expectation), and worst-\/case.

This command is intended to be only used by the {\bfseries sp} script, which drives both heuristic and exact solvers.
\subsection{Notes}\label{randomsampleExecutable_randomsampleNotes}

\begin{itemize}
\item The randomsample heuristic currently does not support side constraints other than on the number of sensors. Side-\/constraints are supported by the \doxyref{sideconstraints}{p.}{sideconstraintsExecutable} executable. 
\end{itemize}
