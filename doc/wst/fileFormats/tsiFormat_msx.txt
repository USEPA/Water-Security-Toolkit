<NodeIDi>:		EPANET ID identifying the ith node where the contaminant is 
			introduced.  [Character string]
<SrcTypeIDXi>:		The EPANET source type index of the ith contaminant source.  
			Each EPANET source type is associated with an integer index 
			(see EPANET 2.00.12 toolkit documentation for reference). [Integer]
<SrcSpecieIDXi>:	The EPANET species index of the ith contaminant source. [Integer]
<SrcStrngthi>:		The strength of the ith contaminant source (see EPANET 2.00.12 
			documentation for description of sources). This value 
			represents the product of contaminant flow rate and 
			concentration. [Real number]
<Starti>:		The time, in seconds, measured from the start of simulation, 
			when the ith contaminant injection is started. [Integer]
<Stopi>:		The time, in seconds, measured from the start of simulation, 
			when the ith contaminant injection is stopped. [Integer]

One water quality simulation will be run for each scenario specified in the threat 
simulation input (TSI) file. For each such simulation, the source associated with each 
contaminant location <NodeIDi>, i=1,,N will be activated as the specified type source, 
and all other water quality sources disabled. If a source node is specified in the 
EPANET 2.00.12 input file, the baseline source strength and source type options will be ignored, 
but the source pattern will be used, if one is specified.
