<Srci>:	 A label that describes the ith source location of an N-source ensemble.  
	     This can be either: 1) An EPANET node ID label identifying one node where 
	     contaminant is introduced, 2) The string "ALL" (without quotes) denoting 
	     all junction nodes (excluding tanks and reservoirs), or 3) The string "NZD" 
	     denoting all junction nodes with non-zero demands. This simple language 
	     allows easy specification of single- or multi-source ensembles.  
<SrcType>:   The source type, one of: MASS, CONCEN, FLOWPACED, SETPOINT (see EPANET 2.00.12 
	     user manual for information about these types of water quality sources). 
	     [Character string]
<SrcSpecie>: The character ID of the water quality specie added by the source.  
	     This parameter must be omitted when using executables built from the 
	     standard EPANET 2.00.12 distribution [Character string]
<SrcStrngth>: The strength of the contaminant source (see EPANET 2.00.12 documentation for 
             the various source types. 
<Start>:     The time, in seconds, measured from the start of simulation, when the 
	     contaminant injection is started. [Integer]
<Stop>:      The time, in seconds, measured from the start of simulation, when the 
	     contaminant injection is stopped. [Integer]

Examples are given below. [Character strings]

One scenario with a single injection at node ID "10", mass rate of 5 mg/min of specie 
SPECIE1, start time of 0 and stop time of 1000:
10     MASS    SPECIE1    5     0     1000

Multiple scenarios with single injections at all non-zero demand junctions:
NZD   MASS    SPECIE1   5     0     1000

Multiple scenarios with two injections, one at node ID "10", and the other at all 
non-zero demand junctions:
10     NZD     MASS     SPECIE1   5     0     1000

Multiple scenarios with three injections, at all combinations of all junction nodes 
(if there are N junction  nodes, this would generate N^3 scenarios for the ensemble):
ALL     ALL     ALL   MASS   SPECIE1   5     0     1000

Note: this language will generate scenarios with repeat instances of injection node 
locations (e.g., ALL    ALL would generate one scenario for node i and j, and another 
identical one for node j and i).  Also, it will generate multi-source scenarios with 
the same node repeated.  In this latter case, the source mass rate at the repeated 
node is the mass rate specified in <SrcStrngth>.
