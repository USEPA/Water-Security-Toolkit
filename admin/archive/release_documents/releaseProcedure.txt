TEVA Software Release Procedure
===============================

A software release of TEVA occurs in four stages, called "Plan", 
"Do", "Check" and "Act".  The progress of the four stages is
documented with a checklist and some supporting information.  
The checklist and supporting documents are all text files maintained 
in the "qa" directory of the acro source tree, in a sub directory 
named with the release number.

When you add release documents to a release subdirectory of the
"qa" directory, you should also add links to the documents from
the file "qa/qa.html".

"Plan":

To begin the release process, obtain the "TEVA Software Release
Process Checklist", which may be found in the repository at
qa/docs/release.txt.

Decide what the new release will be numbered, and create a new 
directory in "qa" named {major}_{minor}.  Format the directory
name so information about release 3.02 would be found in 
directory "qa/03_02".

Copy the release.txt file into the directory you just created.

Fill out the "PLAN" section of the release checklist, and then
check the file in to the repository.

Under the section titled "Dates", you will lay out a time schedule
for the release.  This will usually require some supporting information,
which is explained in the following paragraphs.

 o "release components identified" is the date by which you will have identified
   everything that should be in the release.  This list may include the numbers
   of bugs that are to be fixed, features that will be added, or documentation
   that will be written.  When this list is completed, check it into
   the release subdirectory as "releaseComponents.txt".  An example is in
   the "qa/docs" directory.

 o "release test plan identified" is the date by which you will create a
   high level list of tests that will be run as part of the release process.
   (It can be as simple as "all smoke tests and all performance tests").
   Also identify which tests' output will will be saved in the 
   "qa/{major}_{minor}" directory.  Check it in to the release directory
   as "releaseTestPlan.txt".  An example is in the "qa/docs"
   directory.
   
 o "create release branch" is the date that you will cease allowing new
   development to the code base that will become the release.  You should
   allow only bug fixes, documentation, and enhancements to the configure
   and build process.  This freeze is accomplished by creating a branch 
   to the CVS repository for the release.  New development will occur 
   in the trunk.

 o "third party requirements completed" - It is necessary to identify the
   version of third party software packages that will be distributed with
   TEVA.  For Sandia software, we may have additional requirements that we
   have requested of the package developers for our release.  All
   third party requirements should be identified by this date.  A checklist
   of requirements should be checked in to the release subdirectory as
   "thirdPartyRequirements.txt".  There is an example in "qa/docs".
   
 o "configure/install working" is the date by which we will verify our
   release will be easy to download, build and install.
   
 o "documentation complete" is the date by which all documentation listed
   in the "release components" will be completed.
   
 o "testing complete" is the date by which we will be done testing the
   code.

 o "customer satisfaction plan created" - The project manager should
   create a checklist of steps that will be taken in the weeks following
   the release (if the release was to a specific customer) to ensure
   that the customer is happy and to get feedback to apply to future
   releases.  Check out qa/docs/customerSatisfaction.txt as a starting
   point.
   
 o "release" is the date on which the code will be made available to users.

"Do":

In the "do" stage, the planned activities are carried out.  

The "Customer satisfaction plan" should state clearly how we will 
determine that the customer or stakeholder is happy with the release.  
A suggested plan may be found in "qa/docs/customerSatisfaction.txt".  
(The customer or stakeholders were identified during the planning
stage.)  

"Check": In this stage, we verify that the planned activities
occured successfully.  

"Act": In the final stage, we release the code and begin the process
of ensuring it meets customer's need.
